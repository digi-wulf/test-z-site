I was out of town for the week, but believe me that you, Norma, and your whole family are in my heart. Your family is a musical, emotional, and spiritual inspiration to generations of people who connect with the joy that each of you exhumes through music and love.

     <p class="Body-Style---no-indent" id="u8117-39">Javier, I am sorry to hear of your fathers passing. I have been in La Crosse, Wisconsin for the past week and a half with my older brother for a camping trip and small vacation (where it was about 15 degrees cooler than here all the time). So i haven't written back, as we didn't take any computers. I just got home last night. My mother (age 84!) went into breast cancer surgery the day after I left, she turned out fine, but my wife's father died in June, as you may recall when I came by to see you at sambuca one night. So life goes on. Losing a loved one kinda makes us aware of our own mortality, but is also a gift as it reminds us to live life more fully. That's why i always loved flying airplanes (i am a pilot, bet you didn't know that!)...keeping your own death as a daily reminder to enjoy life to the fullest. We'll all meet again someday anyway! Love to you, Norma, and the rest of your kinfolk,</p>

     <p class="Body-Style---no-indent" id="u8117-44">Javier, It broke my heart to see the pain in your face and body yesterday. I lost my Daddy in 1990 and it was indescribable. You never &quot;get over it&quot; you just learn to live with it. You see, I was &quot;Daddy's Little Girl&quot; even then. He was everything to me and I thought he would always be there...no matter what! And, I know, that your Daddy was everything to you! For 15 years now I still say things that he said and remember the great sense of humor he had. He never knew just how funny he was. He just spoke his mind and everyone would laugh uncontrollably! My children loved him so much. Yes, I still miss my Daddy...and I always will.I try to draw strength from knowing what a great man he was. I will always be there for you if you need anything. I have a great deal of respect for your whole family. I told Norma to include me when it comes to making sure your Mom is not left alone. I won't be able to be there tomorrow night because my Son is here from Rio. He will be here until Monday. So, hopefully I will be able to come to see all of you next Thursday. &quot;Keep your chin up and be strong&quot;!</p>

     <p class="Body-Style---no-indent" id="u8117-66">Hello, Javier: I was at the Houston Press Showcase last night and was saddenned to hear the news of your father's passing. He will be missed not only as one of the pioneers and legends of music in this city, but also as a warm and wonderful human being. The few times I came in contact with him, his positive attitude was contagious. He has certainly passed his legacy through his children both musically and personally. I think he would have been proud of Norma for showing up at the awards. And, I'm glad that Norma received the Award. One more tribute to his legacy. Please receiveour heartfelt sympathy.</p>

I am familiar with Norma's music and I enjoy it completely! Next year it will be my 35th wedding anniversary. I would like to know how much you charge for that type of event. Hopefully my anniversary will be celebrated at a hotel near Bush Intercontinental Airport. The guests come from different backgrounds: Latino, Caucasian, African-American, Caribbean. Can Ms. Zenteno's music repertoire accommodate the different preferences of music?</p>

     <p class="Body-Style---no-indent" id="u8236-31">I am so very sorry to hear about the passing of Mr. Zenteno. I didn't know him extremely well, but when I worked at Mars Music on the 610 Loop I helped him with several large purchases and he was always a joy to work with - the kind of customer you LOVED to see come in the store! The last time I saw him was at Sambuca's one Thursday night a couple of months ago when we (The Grateful Geezers) were playing around the corner at the Mercury Room. We played there a couple of Thursdays a month back then and I tried to slip around the corner each time on one of our breaks and catch y'all. He was just the same that night as always - in a great mood &amp; very jovial...I'll always cherish getting to see him that one last time! I plan on trying to pay my respects at the visitation or funeral. Please trust that my prayers are with you at this crucial time.</p>

I consider him a good friend of mine. My mom and I had planned on going to see you guys at the last &quot;Old Timers&quot; event at the Shriners a few weeks ago but couldn't make it. I'm so sorry about that now. He was always so pleasant and really cool to be around and chat with. My prayers will be with you and your family as you go through this time of mourning. Please let them know that you are all being prayed for. Also know that the Lord above has your dad in a good place and that the same Lord can help you all feel peace.</p>

     <p class="Body-Style---no-indent" id="u8236-90">David and I are so very sorry to hear about your father's death. As you know, my dad and yours go back to their teenage years. I always felt Robertwas a true friend and always there for my family. Through thick and thin he was there giving my dad encouragement during the ups and downs of life. Please know how much he is loved and how much I treasure my childhood memories -- filled with vacations, parties and get togethers when our families saw each other constantly. Our prayers and love always for you and your family.</p>

This is NOT the medium I would think that is proper for something like this. I was in total shock when I read about it in the paper. I was fortunate to have met your Father and I've heard about him since the middle sixtie's. We have truly lost an Icon and a legend Thanks for the message.</p>

When I had dinner with the two of them some years ago, it was such a joy to be around them. How can I say how much I will miss him and how much he will be missed by the world? Please let me know if I can do anything at all for the family. Again, I am so sorry!</p>

Last year I lost my Father, and what comforted me was this poem, and now I want to share it with you - for Roberto was a free spirit, - as he is right now.</p>
